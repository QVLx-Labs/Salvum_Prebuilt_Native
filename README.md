# Salvum_Prebuilt_Native

This is the package deployed for Appalachian State University to support interactive cybersecurity education.

Native Ubuntu 20 LTS installer. For cross-platform Salvum, see containerized

To run execute this command after you've got your Docker running with Desktop or what not:
```
Ubuntu hosts: sudo apt install docker.io
RHEL hosts: sudo yum install containerd.io
```
$t@$h here: I recommend containerized then if you want code contact me its alot of file exchange

Servf, Yara, and PXE functionality taken out of this along with the QVLx FCC db.

This made the image way smaller and easier to work with. Servf should also not work as its been commented.

In conclusion, this installable package is smaller than the full 300+ app version by design.
```
$t@$h r00r00 n3wm4n m0nZSt3r Matzr3lla 0mg33 k!r!t0
